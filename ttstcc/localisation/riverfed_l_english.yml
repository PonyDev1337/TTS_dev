 #### IDEAS ####
 RIV_member_state:0 "Treaty of Coltstream Member"
 RIV_member_state_desc:0 "This state has signed the Treaty of Coltstream. In 898 the River Coalition was founded after an attack by the Griffon Orders was pushed back. The founding members of the treaty were Lake City, Deponya, River Republic and Nimbusia. Although the treaty has been mainly a defensive alliance since its inception, some politicians and their supporters advocate to expand the treaty to allow for more cooperation between the states of the River Coalition."
 RIV_rcsc_member:0 "RCSC Member"
 RIV_rcsc_member_desc:0 "This State has signed the Treaty of Coltstream and has opted into the River Coal and Steel Community. Hailed as an inventive solution to solve rivalry between the states of the Coalition, the RCSC has pooled the markets for coal and steel, the prime resources for warfare. The member states have given authority over these markets to a Coalition oversight committee. By interlinking the industries of warfare between the member states, the RCSC hopes to prevent warfare between its members."
 RIV_rec_member:0 "REC Member"
 RIV_rec_member_desc:0 "This state is a member of the River Economic Community, the successor to the RCSC. The REC has pledged to go beyond just Coal and Steel and incorporate the entire economy. By slashing tariffs between the member states and encouraging and equal playing field for competition, the smaller member states hope to compete against countries with bigger markets. This has meant more authority has flowed to the oversight committee and away from the national governments."
 RIV_river_union_member:0 "River Union Member State"
 RIV_river_union_member_desc:0 "This state is a member of the River Union, the successor to the REC. The Union is much more centralised than its predecessor and has taken responsibility for all sorts of policy areas. Much speculation abounds when the United Parliament will push for more centralisation, which might lead to a full-fledged federation."
 RIV_rdc:0 "River Development Company"
 RIV_rdc_desc:0 "Although in the past the Coalition has done much to develop their neighbours, the help has been undirected and decentralised. To help guide the good intentions of the Coalition to where they are most needed, the River Development Company has been founded. Consolidating funds and experts from all the member states, the RDC uses their assets to help the construction of new factories, highways, railroads and dockyards."
 RIV_beings_rights_idea:0 "River Convention on Beings Rights"
 RIV_beings_rights_idea_desc:0 "This nation is a signatory of the River Convention on Beings Rights"
 RIV_development_grants_idea:0 "Development Grants"
 RIV_centeral_bank_idea:0 "River Central Bank"
 RIV_centeral_bank_idea_desc:0 "For monetary matters, the River Central Bank coordinates our own Central Bank, as well as those of our friends. This will help to keep rampant inflation at bay and ensure that there is always enough money to go around."
 RIV_river_army_idea:0 "The River Army"
 RIV_river_army_idea_desc:0 "We have integrated our armed forces with the River Army. Although the armies of the different states are still formally under the control of their own governments, the River Army Command coordinates and directs the armed forces from now on."

 #### FOCUS ####
 
 #### EVENT ####
 rf.1.t:0 "The Speech"
 rf.1.d:0 "'Citizens, friends and ponies of the Federation. We are entering a new era. President River Swirl has left out a dream for us to achieve, a dream which we can all achieve together in the future. Yet, the problems of old still haunt us. The Plague, the destruction of our lands, even separatism, are all forces that threaten to destroy our dream of a united, strong Federation! But fear not. With a strong, centralized response towards these problems, I am confident that these troubles will not lead our proud nation to falter. I can assure you, ponies of the Federation, that we are working for the future of our country.' Chancellor Twinkle made a speech through the national radio chain of the River Federation today, adressing the problems the country experiences. The speech generally received a warm response, though some leftist Parliament members and analysts questioned the pro-centralist and even strongpony tone of the speech. Nevertheless, most citizens of the Federation, still suffering from the problems of the Hellquill war, welcomed Twinkle’s speech."
 rf.1.a:0 "Perfect. Don’t care what the communists think."

 rf.2.t:0 "The Reaction"
 rf.2.d:0 "River Whirl, leader of the SKR. And daughter of Nova Whirl. Such position granted her a lot of power in the River Federation, even if the SKR never had won an election since, well, forever. It was practically all HSR from the 1000’s. One party rule like this all but guaranteed corruption and stagnation, even if River Swirl’s ‘good intentions’ in retiring last year gained her a lot of praise. Whirl was now preparing for her reaction press release to Twinkle’s speech. Authoritarianism concerns aside, there were other issues more important to the common pony. She looked at the December job numbers: mediocre, economic growth nowhere what Twinkle and Swirl promised by 1030, unemployment reaching 13%, and the markets were as volatile as ever. The Purple Plague, too, and the war’s devastation were even more alarming concerns. Despite Twinkle’s best ‘efforts’, she couldn’t help but notice how slow these projects were moving. Vaccination and reconstruction shouldn’t even take that long. But, she figured, that one party rule tends to produce things like that."
 rf.2.a:0 "Now, I have something to tell the press."

The emotions before the final were high, and soon [Root.GetRCVenue] had over [?global.rc_attendance|0],000 ponies waiting for the first whistle in the match between [rc_runner_up.GetRCTeam] and [rc_winner.GetRCTeam]. [rc_runner_up.GetRCTeam] had their star striker red carded in the last match and it was up to the reserve, due to the injury of the sub. Despite his best efforts, the score ended [rc_runner_up.GetRCTeam] 1, [rc_winner.GetRCTeam] 4."

For once every single representative was present at the parliament building as the vote to form the River Federation took place and passed successfully.

They had all thrown their prejudices aside and worked together to create a society of harmony, democracy and friendship. She thanked all the representatives and said without them this miraculous feat would not have been possible, then burst into tears of joy and went down from the podium to embrace the jubilant representatives."

riverfednews.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today diplomats in East Griffonia officially agreed to the process of Federalising the River Union. The movement was championed by [LCT.GetLeader] of Lake City and many Riverlands states are falling in behind their example with Jezeragrad becoming the new Federal Capital, a move that has drawn both scepticism and celebration as the city was once the capital of a Riverlands united by Lakeish conquest.\n\nIn a speech, [LCT.GetLeader] promised that this was a dawn of a new era of peace an prosperity for the RIverlands and that it was a federation for all and not just the elite of Lake City. But critics continue to claim that this is just another Lakish scheme to reclaim their old empire."

riverfednews.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]A new power has risen in Griffonia, as the previously divided Riverlands have undergone a peaceful transition into a federation. Nimbusia was always wary of losing their sovereignty to the overarching River government, but the new reformist government decided to step over their shadow to protect all riverponies. Their investments in river-wide institutions has seen them taking a leading role in bringing the River Coalition together. With the River Federation now safe under Nimbusia’s wing, Metakeros is determined to make sure that the griffons will never be a threat to ponykind again. With Nimbusia’s military as the tip of the spear, the River Federation will be a formidable fighting force, indeed."

riverfednews.4.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Flanked by diplomats, officials, heads of state and her faithful bodyguard Honoria, Queen White Star today signed the new super-state of the River Federation into official existence.\nQueen White Star’s savvy mix of realpolitik and progressive reform saw Wittenland ascend from eccentric backwater to a dominant position in the River Federation. After internally reforming Wittenland’s archaic system of serfdom, she led a charm offensive of diplomats, fine wine, and magitek development specialists, staffing the River Union with skilled magical bureaucrats and ambitious Wittenland nobles (who unhappily learnt the true meaning of meritocracy).\nHer ascension is expected to bring increasing investment in magitech research and investment, with little changes in wider foreign policy."

Vibrant military parades in Wittenland finery couldn’t lift the foreboding mood for many in attendance.\nHonoria, a unicorn supremacist who overthrew the stagnant nobility of Wittenland, continued her rise to power within the River Union. Through a combination of bullying, generous bribes, skilled magical unicorn bureaucrats and promises of protection from the Griffon threat, she stunned many by raising Wittenland to a dominant power within the union.\nWith the dream of unicorn supremacy finally realised, an increasing focus on magitech and aggressive external foreign policy is expected."

His humility and focus on the fundamentals of equality and education, along with continued advocacy for the rights of weaker, poorer nations, won Wittenland wide, if often grudging respect.\nWith Communism the official ideology of the River Federation, economic turmoil and ideological aggression is feared, but many hope Volaire’s demonstrated decency and pragmatism will help him sheer the ship of state safely."

It were these resources that became a crucial force in bringing the River Coalition together under the sceptre of King Diamondshield. With the River Federation in his paw, many speculate that the King under Mountain is planning to settle any grudges his family still has with the griffons.

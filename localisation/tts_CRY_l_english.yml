CRY_crystal_heart:0 "The Crystal Heart"
CRY_crystal_heart_desc:0 "The Crystal Heart is in the truest sense of the word the heart of the Crystal Empire. It protects the Empire and its ponies from the evil and coldness of the North. But while the protection from the coldness is permanent, the protection against evil has to be activated separately. The heart gains its energy through the unity and love of the crystal ponies, and it is said that it was once, countless years ago, created by the first ruler of the Crystal Empire.\nNot only that, but it is also a key part of the many old traditions of the Crystal ponies, among them the Crystal Fair and the Crystal Jubilee, and the ponies are very proud of it."

CRY_royalty_desc:0 "The Royal Family of the Crystal Empire is consisting of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, or Cadance for short, Prince Shining Armor and their daughter and current ruler of the Empire - Princess Flurry Heart. \nIn the past, the family was always able to prove itself as the legitimate rulers of the Empire. But after the Great War, many ponies started to question their leadership because it is, in their eyes, unable to rebuild and reunite the country after all the struggles the war has brought. For now, the ponies are, despite all of this, still content with their rulers. But with rising criticism from the press, only time can tell how long it will take until Flurry Heart has to make concessions."

This has led to many ponies questioning the ruling family and democratic and republican movements enjoy a historical popularity. Not only that, but they became quite bold in the recent months and years. Protests and strikes are almost daily, with broad support from the news. Right now, the majority of our subjects is still loyal to their princess, but if we don't do something about this very soon, we will have to make concessions and eventually abdicate, or else we risk an escalation of the situation."

CRY_unloyal_crystal_clear_desc:0 "Crystal Clear, or CCL for short, is the most popular and influential news network within the Empire, with almost three million ponies listening to their broadcasts and reading their articles daily. In the last months and years, it caused a stir with its rather left minded editorial staff and by openly supporting the many protests of liberal and even communist groups. Needless to say, this support is not really calming the situation down and they are one major factor of the recent popularity of the leftist movements in our country."

CRY_prewar.1.t:0 "Between Two Fires"
CRY_prewar.1.d:0 "14 years have passed since the last shots of the Great war had sounded, a war which the Crystal Empire had finished in the among the victors. After celebrating the victory, soldiers of the crystal armies began to return to their peaceful lives. Which weren't going to be easy. \nThe war steamrolled through this once peaceful country. More than ⅔ of the country were in ruins. The Crystal Empire had lost a huge amount of ponypower. While retreating, the changelings had destroyed much of the country's infrastructure. \nAt the same time, there was a change in the public minds. Before the war, the Crystal Empire was traditionally seen as an Equestrian puppet. After the war, ponies began to wonder more and more often: how did that happen? How did the war come to their beautiful capital? It seemed that in the darkest times, Celestia had chosen to abandon the crystal ponies to their fate. The population of the Crystal Empire hopes that the abdication of Cadence and the establishment of the young Princess as the head of the Empire will allow the country to communicate on an equal hoof with its southern neighbor. \nThe more attractive is the relationship with a neighbor in the East. Stalliongradian troops took an active part in the defense of the Crystal city, and Stalliongrad heavy tanks became the core of the crystal offensive operations. The infrastructure of the Eastern part of the country was quickly reoriented to Stalliongrad, and the Northern industry found a good consumer for its products.\nThe post-war growth of Communists and Republicans in the Empire poses some threat to the current government, but Princess Flurry hopes for the quick restoration of the country and seeking for a compromise between the opposition and the government.\nThe postwar Crystal Empire stands at a crossroad. Are our bonds with Equestria that strong? Is it worth strengthening relations with the Communists? Or maybe the country will have to affirm its Imperial status and pursue a policy exclusively in its own interests?"
CRY_prewar.1.a:0 "Are there cracks in the Crystal Heart?"
CRY_prewar.2.t:0 "Preparation for the Crystal Fair-1032"
CRY_prewar.2.d:0 "Crystal Fairs are a traditional event in the Crystal Empire. Carried out from the ancient times, they survived both the tyranny of Sombra and the thousand-year disappearance of the entire country. Modern times have turned them into a center of international trade, where each state wants to demonstrate the achievements of its economy and establish beneficial contacts with Crystal Empire and other countries as well."
CRY_prewar.2.a:0 "Let's see."
CRY_prewar.3.t:0 "Into the world"
CRY_prewar.3.d:0 "The upcoming fair will be the second since the end of the Great war. Our country must demonstrate the restoration of the Crystal Empire from the consequences of the war, convince potential investors of the stability of our economy and provide favorable conditions for the further development of our economy. We expect a large number of different proposals from other countries, but the most profitable course for us will be to hold negotiations at the highest level with representatives of the major powers. Favorable agreements for us will open up new prospects for our Industrialists. In this regard, the High Commission for the preparation of the Fair proposed for consideration a list of leaders of countries that need to be given special attention."
CRY_prewar.3.a:0 "Well, well..."
CRY_prewar.4.t:0 "Preparing the city for the holiday"
CRY_prewar.4.d:0 "A Crystal Fair for the Empire is the same as a ball for a mare. There, the mare must show her beauty and elegance... And, of course, to do this, she must wash herself, make a beautiful hairstyle, choose a beautiful dress, etc., so as not to look like a slob. For the Empire, however, well-grooming is in the state of cities. You need to clean the streets, cut trees in the cities, decorate everything with garlands... I hope we have enough budget funds... "
CRY_prewar.4.a:0 "The cheap garlands will do just fine, well, and a simple cleaning of the streets"
CRY_prewar.4.b:0 "To wash the streets with soap. And more crystals! To make everything shine!"
CRY_prewar.4.c:0 "Arrange a complete redecoration of the entire city. Do not spare a single coin!"
CRY_prewar.5.t:0 "To invite the leaders of the opposition?"
CRY_prewar.5.d:0 "The republicans have different views on the Fair. Some oppose this event, which, in their opinion, glorifies the ideals of the monarchy and the inviolability of the current system. Others are inclined to compromise and see nothing untoward in the Crystal Empire's display of hospitality.\n Of course, the supporters of Republican rule in our state do not treat the Princess very well, but if we invite them to the Fair, it will not only help to establish a dialogue with their representatives, but also show the whole world that any differences fade before the traditions and culture of our great people. After all, even Communists don't mind a Cup or two of cider."
CRY_prewar.5.a:0 "So be it!"
CRY_prewar.5.b:0 "Want to abolish the traditional monarchy? We will cancel the traditional fair for them."
CRY_prewar.6.t:0 "Protection Of Fair"
CRY_prewar.6.d:0 "Crystal city, of course, has never seen a problem of high crime rate, but holding such a responsible event as the Fair sets our government the task of ensuring maximum security for all its participants and, first of all, for those prominent guests who were sent by the countries invited to the Fair. Of course, you can limit yourself to the police, but in such case, the prestige of our country is at the stake."
CRY_prewar.6.a:0 "Regular police and the royal guards should be enough."
CRY_prewar.6.b:0 "Send the military police there"
CRY_prewar.6.c:0 "Such a grand event has to be protected by special forces"
CRY_prewar.7.t:0 "Invite the Crystal Clear"
CRY_prewar.7.d:0 "This is the oldest and the most popular publication in the entire Crystal Empire. But over time, their journalists slowly but surely became oppositionists. Someone is a liberal republican, someone is a social democrat,and someone is a communist. As a result, this publication became the voice of the entire opposition. These oppositionists criticize any actions of the government, and the preparation of the fair Is no exception. You only have to look at any of their newspapers or radio programs and you will see all sorts of materials about the theft and corruption that supposedly took place during the work of the High Commission for the preparation of the Fair. Let's invite them to the Fair and make sure that all their articles are worthless, and at the same time try to bribe one of them."
CRY_prewar.7.a:0 "These oafs do not care, as long as they can throw mud at us. Prohibit them from being here!"
CRY_prewar.7.b:0 "Well, we are not animals after all. Just let them in."
CRY_prewar.7.c:0 "We will buy their love. Lets give them exclusive broadcast rights."
CRY_prewar.8.t:0 "A small problem"
CRY_prewar.8.d:0 "Although branches of the Fair will open in all major cities of the Empire, the center of the Fair, as always, is the Crystal city. The post-war period was an era of major industrial growth and transformation of our capital into one of the largest in the world. Unfortunately, this development always brings with some...problems. The main streets of this magnificent city are crystal clear, but if a traveler wants to visit the outskirts of the city, he will be a little surprised by the large amounts of industrial waste and, more importantly, the homeless. If we want to leave a good impression at the fair, we will have to do something about it."
CRY_prewar.8.a:0 "Trash or pleb - get all this filth off our streets!"
CRY_prewar.8.b:0 "Do we have that many homeless? We will take them to the shower, give them new clothes - and that's the staff for the Fair."
CRY_prewar.8.c:0 "Who would go there anyway?"
CRY_prewar.9.t:0 "Lack of funds"
CRY_prewar.9.d:0 "It seems that we have spent too much money. There is a lack of budget. So we had to make up for it by cutting some edges in our economy."
CRY_prewar.9.a:0 "I need to learn how to plan expenses..."
CRY_prewar.10.t:0 "Who is to be invited from Equestria"
CRY_prewar.10.d:0 "Equestria is a traditional guest of the Crystal Fair. Without our southern neighbor, this event loses much of it's charm. Despite some cold in relations between our countries, we simply have to invite a representative from Equestria. It remains only to choose who.\n Celestia is a good option. Her sister Luna is known not only as the second reigning Princess, but also as one of the outstanding commanders of the allied forces during the Great war. Twilight Sparkle was able not only to take a high position in Equestria, but also wrote her name in the history of our state, by taking a direct action in overthrowing of the tyranny of Sombra. Finally, we can also invite Cadence, who moved to Equestria after her abdication, but this option may cause some... problems."
CRY_prewar.10.a:0 "Celestia. Prepare the cakes!"
CRY_prewar.10.b:0 "Luna. The fun has to be doubled!"
CRY_prewar.10.c:0 "Twilight. Let's add some intellectualism."
CRY_prewar.10.e:0 "Cadence! A former Princess of our Empire!"
CRY_prewar.11.t:0 "Who is to be invited from Stalliongrad"
CRY_prewar.11.d:0 "The modern Severyana was born in the revolution against the equestrian capitalists and aristocrats. Communists always oppose monarchies, and our's is no exception. However, the events of the Great war have shown that even they are willing to leave ideological differences for the sake of helping their neighbors. The crystal ponies will always be grateful to the Stalliongradians for their invaluable contribution to our overall victory over the changelings, and therefore we simply have to invite one of their leaders to the Fair."
CRY_prewar.11.a:0 "Vasiliy. Good old friend."
CRY_prewar.11.b:0 "Yegor Potapov. Maybe you can talk to him about a couple of contracts?"
CRY_prewar.11.c:0 "Let's invite someone simpler. Let's get this simple party member... She is an academician of cybernetics? Delightful."
CRY_prewar.12.t:0 "Who is to be invited from Griffonia"
CRY_prewar.12.d:0 "Over the past 20 years, the Griffonian Empire has managed to restore its former power and unite the scattered suburbs, that broke away at the end of the last century, around the Emperor. It is now a major power on the West coast of Gryphonia, and we have to reckon with it. Even though they supported the changelings during the Great war, their technology and capitals can be useful to our industry.\n Who should I invite? Of course, Emperor Grover VI is the most acceptable option, but it is worth considering his young age: for sure, he will be assigned some smart Griffin. Let's see who else we can invite."
CRY_prewar.12.a:0 "Grover on his own should be enough."
CRY_prewar.12.b:0 "Grover his descendants."
CRY_prewar.12.c:0 "Grover and the chaplain Schonerer."
CRY_prewar.13.t:0 "Who is to be invited from River Federation"
CRY_prewar.13.d:0 "The River Federation originated from the Union of the pony states in the east of Griffonia. Geographically, they are extremely far away from us, but their young industry can bring profits to our industrialists. They're also ponies. It's nice to see your fellow brothers and sisters from a continent full of griffons. We don't know their political hierarchy very well, but these three ponies seem to be the best candidates."
CRY_prewar.13.a:0 "Nightly Twinkle. She is a leader after all."
CRY_prewar.13.b:0 "River Whirl. A good mare."
CRY_prewar.13.c:0 "River Swirl. Let's invite this veteran of politics."
CRY_prewar.14.t:0 "Who else do we invite"
CRY_prewar.14.d:0 "So, we have sent out the invitations to representatives of the largest states. Now to the lesser business. You can invite a representative from Wingbardy, which has grown into a major player in the political arena of Griffonia. On the other hand, democratic changelings deserve our attention, and inviting them to the Fair will allow us to show that old grievances can be forgotten for the sake of a better future and prosperity of our states. Finally, don't forget about South-Eastern Griffonia. The controversial bloc that has formed there is doing its best to defend the fragile balance in the region. Perhaps by inviting the leader of the Prywhen Republic, we can establish a dialogue with this bloc."
CRY_prewar.14.a:0 "Umberto. Let him unwind"
CRY_prewar.14.b:0 "Thorax. He deserved it."
CRY_prewar.14.c:0 "Redglad. We need to establish at least some sort of contacts."
CRY_prewar.14.e:0 "Rose Maledicta. That would be a sight to see for sure."
CRY_prewar.15.t:0 "Final preparations"
CRY_prewar.15.d:0 "So, the streets are washed and swept, roads are laid, invitations are sent and tents are prepared. Overall, the preparation for the Fair was successful and now you can invite guests. \nWe have spent a lot of money on advertising our event and now we can be sure that guests will come to us from all continents. Let the Fair show that despite the huge destruction caused to our country during the Great war, we were able not only to survive, but also to make our country stronger and more beautiful than ever before. Let the celebration begin, and let no one go out unpleased!"
CRY_prewar.15.a:0 "Let's begin!"
CRY_crystal_fair.5.t:0 "A diary from the past"
CRY_crystal_fair.5.d:0 "After a whole day of negotiations and strolls through the halls of the Crystal City, all the high guests of the Fair gathered in a separate hall for a banquet. They celebrated the crystal hospitality and these beautiful days when races from all the continents gather in the Crystal City for the celebration of peace and freedom. n\Oldest of the alicorn sisters, being tired of the endless toasts, decided to look out to the balcony. In the light of the fireworks, her gaze caught the silhouette of a tall unicorn with blood-red hair.\ n -Field Marshal Maledicta, I suppose? Celeste asked politely. When the answer was yes, she stood beside the silhouette. \n-It is good that this sky is bursting with fireworks, not shrapnel. Rosa watched the huge explosions of the fireworks with a pale smile. Reflected in the crystals that hung so lavishly over the city, they multiplied in number.\ n -It's Scary to think, - the Princess said thoughtfully. "I've lived for hundreds of years. I've seen a lot of wars, I've seen some crazy villains, I've seen incredible cataclysms. But could I have thought in those old times that one day half the continent would be cut into two parts, living only on the desire to destroy each other? In some ten years, the world has almost gone mad...\n-By the way, all of this can really be for a reason.\nRosa looked back cautiously. There was no one else on the balcony. She pulled a scroll from her pocket and handed it to Celestia. \n -I found this in the notes of the deceased Headmaster Torygg. It looks like the delusions of an old bird who is out of his mind, as he really was, but who knows...\nThe Princess carefully unfolded the time-worn paper. From the obscure trembling lines, it followed that all the conflicts that were going on and coming in the world were part of some big plan, behind which were... \n-Wendigos? Really, nonsense. With a chuckle, the Princess returned the scroll. - Wendigo disappeared hundreds of years ago, and Trigg died in the year 1007. He couldn't have known what was going to happen. \n-He was killed. And, unfortunately, they weren't my servants. The unicorn smiled bitterly. "I don't know who I hated more, the old master or the one who wouldn't let me get even with him, but it looks very suspicious.\n - Maybe, - agreed the Princess, turning away in the direction of the fireworks. "Only if it was a plan, it would keep going." And who wants to fight after a war like the Great one? Millions died and hundreds of cities were destroyed. And all this has specific reasons and names.\n-And if this is what they wanted? Rose glared at alicorn. "If it was all a huge sacrifice?" \nCelestia continued to watch the fireworks. \n-I think we should talk about this at another time and place.\nAlicorn turned to rose. \n-I suggest we go back to the guests, so as not to be late for dessert. They say that the best confectioners from all over the Empire are gathered here. Celestia said in a good-natured manner. \nAfter a moment, the two ponies went back into the pavilion full of dignitaries."
CRY_crystal_fair.5.a:0 "Is this all the work of ancient beings from the past?"
CRY_crystal_fair.6.t:0 "Blue feathers"
CRY_crystal_fair.6.d:0 "Inviting Umberto and Grover VI to the Fair together was a mistake. Arguments between them broke out at the very moment when the young Kaiser, who arrived on his own plane, reproached the aging Umberto for preferring to travel by train. But the hottest of their disputes began over a simple souvenir depicting the Idol of Boreas, which by an absurd accident was given to the king of Wingbardia. \n - It is Symbolic that the king of Wingbardia gets this statuette with the same ease with which he moves his tanks to where it's original once was... - Grover said with a smile. \n But the aging king was not deaf.\n-A boy trying to usurp the entire history of the gryphons is unlikely to live to my age. - the king did not remain silent.\nThe extreme arguments and veiled insults that followed later from both sides, led to the fact that already at the official reception in the palace, both gryphons smiled and shook hands with each other, asking for forgiveness. Unfortunately for both of them, the details of the altercation, thanks to the efforts of the journalist Crystal Clear, became known to the public."
CRY_crystal_fair.6.a:0 "Those griffons are at it again..."
CRY_crystal_fair.7.t:0 "Who is responsible for day and night?"
CRY_crystal_fair.7.d:0 "When chaplain Schonerer arrived in the country with the Emperor, he enjoyed a beautiful sunny day, for which he thanked Boreas out of an old habit, until he was interrupted by a quiet grin from the equestrian Princess. However, contrary to alicorn's expectations, the priest turned around and, to the Emperor's horror, bluntly declared that the sun and moon did not care about some earthly stuffed animal with horns and wings.\nSuch disputes have never hurt the alicorn sisters, but the fact that this happened in front of many people threatens a diplomatic row between the two major powers of Equus and Griffonia."
CRY_crystal_fair.7.a:0 "Just as always..."
CRY_crystal_fair.8.t:0 "Have I ever seen the gods?"
CRY_crystal_fair.8.d:0 "Chaplain Schoenerer stood out from the crowd and that was no surprise, he quickly ran into a pony that had arrived from Stalliongrad. The conversation between the two zealous representatives of opposed beliefs was not going to be pleasant from the very beginning, but no one expected such a lively discussion would last for many days. Both sides, standing their ground to the end, managed to earn the hatred of their opponent. There were rumors in the newspapers that after returning home, the two fanatics still continue to scribble multi-page letters to each other, in which they give evidence, refutations and links to sources of information."

CRY_crystal_heart:0 "The Crystal Heart"
CRY_crystal_heart_desc:0 "The Crystal Heart is in the truest sense of the word the heart of the Crystal Empire. It protects the Empire and its ponies from the evil and coldness of the North. But while the protection from the coldness is permanent, the protection against evil has to be activated separately. The heart gains its energy through the unity and love of the crystal ponies, and it is said that it was once, countless years ago, created by the first ruler of the Crystal Empire.\nNot only that, but it is also a key part of the many old traditions of the Crystal ponies, among them the Crystal Fair and the Crystal Jubilee, and the ponies are very proud of it."
CRY_royalty:0 "The Royal Family"
CRY_royalty_desc:0 "The Royal Family of the Crystal Empire is consisting of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, or Cadance for short, Prince Shining Armor and their daughter and current ruler of the Empire - Princess Flurry Heart. \nIn the past, the family was always able to prove itself as the legitimate rulers of the Empire. But after the Great War, many ponies started to question their leadership because it is, in their eyes, unable to rebuild and reunite the country after all the struggles the war has brought. For now, the ponies are, despite all of this, still content with their rulers. But with rising criticism from the press, only time can tell how long it will take until Flurry Heart has to make concessions."
CRY_republican_protests:0 "Republican Protests"
CRY_republican_protests_desc:0 "After the Great War, a large part of our country, especially in the West, is laying devastated and the last thing the Crystal ponies want is another war. This has led to many ponies questioning the ruling family and democratic and republican movements enjoy a historical popularity. Not only that, but they became quite bold in the recent months and years. Protests and strikes are almost daily, with broad support from the news. Right now, the majority of our subjects is still loyal to their princess, but if we don't do something about this very soon, we will have to make concessions and eventually abdicate, or else we risk an escalation of the situation."
CRY_unloyal_crystal_clear:0 "Critical CCL"
CRY_unloyal_crystal_clear_desc:0 "Crystal Clear, or CCL for short, is the most popular and influential news network within the Empire, with almost three million ponies listening to their broadcasts and reading their articles daily. In the last months and years, it caused a stir with its rather left minded editorial staff and by openly supporting the many protests of liberal and even communist groups. Needless to say, this support is not really calming the situation down and they are one major factor of the recent popularity of the leftist movements in our country."

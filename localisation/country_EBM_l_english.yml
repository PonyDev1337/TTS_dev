baltimare.100.t:0 "Mayoral Election"
baltimare.100.d:0 "\tThis year's local election in Baltimare has been one of the most contested elections in the state's history. Since the beginning, Baltimare with its industrial base and large dockyards has been a hotbed for socialist leaning in Equestria and since the Great War this tendency has been very concerning to Canterlot. This election however came in the midst of rising tensions between Equestria and Stalliongrad, and various socialist leaning political groups have mysteriously dropped out of the mayoral race, leading many to blame Canterlot for election interference. In the end, this election has been a close race between Caramel Rain, a reform learning harmonist, and Azure Sky, a hardline pro-Canterlot candidate. As the race draws to a close the tensions between the pro-Autonomy and pro-Canterlot groups have heated up resulting in some street brawls. In addition, in the last few weeks there have been some minor strikes as the various soclialist parties without a candidate have expressed distaste that the election is no longer fair as both candidates are more or less harmonist candidates. Whoever wins, the election in a few days could very well make or break the status quo in Baltimare."
baltimare.100.a:0 "How Exciting!"
baltimare.101.t:0 "Acceptance Speech"
baltimare.101.d:0 "As polling draws to a close it has become clear that despite a close race it seems the pro-Canterlot hardliner candidate Azure Sky has emerged victorious. Despite the heated election race, the actual voting has been peaceful. However, with the recent announcement that Azure Sky has won it is likely there will be more unrest in the coming weeks. This has been a boon not only to the Canterlot administration but also the major military and business interests in the Baltimare region. Soon after the results were announced Azure Sky made an acceptance speech on national television:\n\n \“My fellow Ponies of Baltimare. I would first like to thank all of my supporters for making this victory possible. I would also like to thank all who voted today, no matter who they voted for, for keeping this election process peaceful and keeping the polls safe for anypony to express their democratic rights. Now is the time to come back together. No matter who you voted for, as the new mayor I ask you to put your trust in me. This state now until the next election must rally behind the current administration as now my success is your success, my failures are your failures. No matter your views, one thing this election has made clear is that everypony in Baltimare wants change. I am here to bring change to align us more with those in Canterlot. Some of you may want independence, and while I want this too, now is not the time for such a move. We stand at the brink of open conflict, a conflict that could be far deadlier than the war fought years ago against the Changeling menace. Like it or not, we are at war even if no shots are being fired. However despite this risk Equestria stands divided. On paper we may all be tied to the government in Canterlot, but should a major conflict break out our situation would be quite dire. Because of this, we must change course and move to be more inline with the Princessdom. We must endeavor to unite until the point at which the world is no longer on the brink of destruction. And when this cold war we find ourselves in dies down and when us being independent from the Princessdom would leave us better off than worse I will gladly support independence. I ask you to trust me. Allow me to safeguard our Baltimare, and to ensure that we remain secure, secure until the day that the world is no longer on the brink. So that we may survive and thrive to achieve independence in the future. Thank you.\”"

baltimare.102.t:0 "The Dust Settles in Baltimare"
baltimare.102.d:0 "As expected, the election of Azure Mist has proved to be very controversial in the state of Baltimare. The response from the Harmonist parties, both the conservative and progressive branches has been largely positive. Worries in Baltimare and abroad that this contested election could upset the Harmonist establishment in a vital region have largely been eased. Support has been coming in from the Princessdom of Equestria and the other autonomies as a whole seem content with the election results. However, despite the foreign support the same tension from before the election has continued. The pro-independence movement started protesting the day after the election results were announced. There has been some looting, though overall both the government and protesters have been peaceful. However, the most impactful response has come from the various socialist groups which called for a general strike following the election results. While these strikes have been relatively small over the past few days they have been growing in numbers. As it stands now the response from the local government has been relatively muted, though if these strikes continue there may be an escalation due to the strategic importance of Baltimare’s ports to Equestria. There has been no response from the mayor's office as yet, though this is certainly not the start Azure’s administration wanted."
baltimare.102.a:0 "Well we had peace for a day"
baltimare.103.t:0 "A Heated Meeting"
baltimare.103.d:0 "The air in the mayor's waiting room could be cut with a knife. The mayor’s new cabinet sat still and silent, all waiting for Azure Mist to finish her call to Canterlot and to start the daily meeting. What should have been a routine meeting was more like an emergency briefing. Not even a week in and the new administration was dealing with protests and worse yet strikes that were growing day by day and starting to have an impact on the output of Baltimare’s key industry. With things heating up in the North, the Princessdom called the mayor's office early. Everyone knew why Centerlot called. Baltimare was strategically important and needed to stay with Equestria. And so far its newest Mayor was failing to live up to the expectations of the capital. Azure Mist was certainly feeling the stress. After all, usually winning an election was followed by celebration. These problems weren’t supposed to come up until the next election came around.\n\n Finally the thick silence in the waiting room was met by a slam, followed by the distinct sound of a phone being thrown at a wall. Seconds passed, and a buzzer sounded from the receptionist desk. She looked warily at the cabinet and said “The Mayor will see you for the daily meeting.” As they entered the office Azure was already seated at the end of the table. Looking oddly calm considering the recent outburst. After a long exhale, Azure started \“Gentlestallions, I just got off the phone with some very important ponies in the capital.\" She grabbed a newspaper out of her bag, looked it over, and slammed it into the table making the long metal structure creak. \“WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS\”! Azure screamed, sliding the paper to the center. The headline showed that the strikes had hit every dockyard in Baltimare, including the military owned ones. \“We have a job to keep stability and be an asset to the Princesses. And yet in only two days our economy has become fucking paralyzed! We look like a failure and we've been in office less than a week. What happened?!\” It seemed like years of silence passed as somepony tried to offer a solution. Though no one could. The problem was they didn’t do anything they could undue to ease the unrest. All they did was get elected. After what seemed like forever, General Lightning, the low ranking general in charge of Baltimare’s national guard spoke. \“I agree this is getting out of hand. We are not equipped to deal with this using local police. We need to act now. Call Canterlot back and ask them to..\” \“Absolutely not!\” Azure said mid sentence. \“We just got into office. We can’t go begging Centerlot to solve our problems three days in!\” \“I understand your sentiment ma'am. But from what we've seen these paralyzing strikes aren’t going anywhere. What’s worse, asking for help now or letting the situation deteriorate until Canterlot steps in with or without our consent?\” Azure simply looked down. The General was right. The Princessdom wouldn’t ignore this forever. It was the better move to ask for help now before things get out of hand."
